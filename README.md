# CS50xFinalProject - Traveller's Journeys social media app

### This is a personal project to practice and exhibit the skills that I have obtained while studying cs50x from Harvard University.

- Utilising python3, html, CSS and Flask I will create an interactive web application whereby people can share their travel experiences.
- This data (names, dates of visits, cities and landmarks visited etc) will be stored in a database, using sqlite3.
- There will be some logic in the python app whereby these landmarks will be converted into coordinates.
- The app will then use the google maps API to upload the coordinates of different landmarks and attach avatars of users to matching        locations on a map of the world.
- The locations will then be visualised using a google Earth style visualisation (spin-able globe).
