# CS50xFinalProject - Traveller's Journeys social media app

### This is a personal project to practice and exhibit the skills that I have obtained while studying cs50x from Harvard University.

- Utilising python3, html, CSS and Flask I will create an interactive web application whereby people can share their travel experiences.
- These experiences, including dates, cities and landmarks visited, ages, genders etc will be stored in a database using sqlite3.
- The app will then use the google maps API to upload the coordinates of different countries and attach avatars of users to matching locations on a map of the world.
- The locations will then be visualised using a google Earth style visualisation (spin-able globe).
